The project involves creating a wearable device integrated with an OLED display that reflects its output onto a mirror.
Positioned in front of the mirror is a transparent screen, such as acrylic or glass, where the reflected image is displayed.
The device, powered by a microcontroller like the ESP32, connects to a mobile device via Wi-Fi to receive real-time data. 
The wearer of the device can conveniently view the displayed information through the transparent screen, providing a seamless and hands-free experience.
